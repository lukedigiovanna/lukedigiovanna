Hello! I am a computer science and mathematics student at Virginia Tech. I am interested in the full breadth of computer science, but I have recently been delving into the field of web development. Even more recently I have found an interest in information retrieval systems such as search engines and recommendation algorithms.

May not the world last twenty million years longer? if so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?
