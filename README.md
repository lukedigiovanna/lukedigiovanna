Hello! I am a computer science and mathematics student at Virginia Tech. I am interested in the full breadth of computer science, but here's a list of a few of my favorite areas:

- Information retrieval systems
- Graphics (3D, shaders, etc.)
- Web dev
- Realtime networking
- Simulation

Quotes that I like:

> Assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? if so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?

> Among the bad jokes evolution has played on us are these: 1) We have brains that can conceive of states of perfection they can't achieve, _2) We have brains that compare our insides to other people's outsides,_ 3) We have brains desperate to stay alive, yet we are finite beings who perish. There are many more, of course.
